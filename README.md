# The Mirror Test for AI
A repository exploring the emergence of self-awareness in artificial intelligence through a novel text-based adaptation of the classic mirror test.

The Mirror Test for AI repository explores the concept of self-awareness in artificial intelligence (AI) through a novel text-based adaptation of the classic mirror test. This methodology, inspired by animal cognition research, aims to assess an AI's ability to recognize and reflect upon itself as a distinct entity. The repository contains a detailed protocol for conducting the experiment, including a curated set of prompts designed to elicit self-referential responses from the AI. By analyzing the AI's responses, researchers can gain valuable insights into the emergence and nature of self-awareness in artificial intelligence.
